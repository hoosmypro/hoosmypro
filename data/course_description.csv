GBUS 7600,"This course is designed for the student who wants to be optimally prepared to perform quantitative analysis at a level consistent with (and exceeding) expectations for MBA interns in positions where quantitative sophistication is required. Its only prerequisite is the first-year Decision Analysis course; no additional quantitative experience or acumen is required. The course will focus primarily on data analysis, used to both gain useful insights into relationships and make better, more useful forecasts. In addition to more advanced treatment of regression analysis (the goal being for students to be able to build and apply sophisticated regression models), students will become familiar with other common approaches to forecasting, such as rudimentary time-series analysis. Students will also improve their ability to structure, analyze, and manage situations involving uncertainty and risk, using simulation (Crystal Ball), decision trees, and the other tools introduced in the required Decision Analysis course. Finally, the course will introduce students to the concepts of optimization using Excel's Solver add-in, used to determine how to optimally allocate resources in situations involving complex trade-offs."
GBUS 7601,"This course is intended to provide students with a comprehensive conceptual and applied understanding of our society's accounting and financial reporting system and an in-depth look at the numerous factors that managers and executives must consider as they confront complex and difficult financial accounting and reporting issues. Students will examine significant financial accounting and reporting issues from both a rigorous theoretical perspective and an informed practical perspective. Students will explore such traditional issues as revenue recognition, inventory valuation, and leases, and such contemporary issues as mergers and acquisitions, intangibles, and financial derivatives. Although the primary focus of the course will be on accounting and reporting practices in the United States, students will also address selected differences between U.S. accounting standards and international accounting standards. How the major accounting scandals that have occurred in recent years have affected the financial reporting process and those who have the responsibility for insuring the accuracy of a company's published financial statements will also be addressed. [l1] By the conclusion of this course, students should be reasonably proficient at understanding, interpreting, and analyzing the information contained in corporate financial statements and their related footnotes, and also be able to assess the overall quality of a company's financial reporting, identify the critical accounting policies, and make an assessment regarding the reasonableness of those policies and their supporting estimates and judgments."
GBUS 7602,"This course emphasizes the development of technical skills that enable students to improve their understanding of global financial markets.

Students will examine how interest rates are impacted by such factors as central-bank behavior, fiscal policy, the state of the business cycle, productivity, inflation expectations, and international capital flows. For currencies, students will develop two related tool kits: one that is useful for understanding the drivers of orderly changes in exchange rates, and a second, through the construction of an early-warning system, that focuses on factors associated with large and potentially disorderly depreciations. Students will also investigate ways in which firms and investors manage interest-rate and currency exposure, as well as how countries manage exchange rates. The course, which includes both technical readings and cases, should appeal to a broad array of students, especially those who wish to pursue careers in investment banking, international finance, and general management."

GBUS 8280,"This course introduces students to selected areas of business law of particular relevance to general managers and their financial advisers, excluding tax law. The focus is less on the substance of particular legal rules, for which managers rely on their legal advisers, and more on the basic tools of legal analysis. This knowledge adds value in two respects. First, it facilitates communication with lawyers and understanding the advice they provide. Second, it demonstrates a way of analyzing problems that is different from, but complementary to, those taught in core business courses. The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts.

GBUS 8453,"This course explores a comprehensive set of financial situations that arise in high-growth and high-risk enterprises. It focuses primarily on the investment phase of the private equity cycle and examines the investment strategy, valuation, and structure of ventures in their formative stages prior to becoming public companies. A range of enterprises are examined from early stage (venture capital) to late stage (mezzanine financing and buyouts) to provide perspective on how the maturity of an organization influences the nature and structure of financing and valuation. Issues related to the measurement of returns in private equity funds, valuing enterprises at different stages of development, and structuring deals using various forms of financing are covered as well as the analytical methods to better measure performance and value enterprises. Students will examine how each party's view of the value of the enterprise forms a basis for negotiation upon which the percentage of equity participation and the terms of the contract are determined as well as how the pricing and terms depend not only the deal itself but also upon prevailing market conditions. As private equity firms are either rapidly growing or changing organizations, students will learn that there must be sufficient flexibility and appropriate incentives built into the current round of capital raising and the contract terms to carry the firm through its next stage of development."
GBUS 8456,This course introduces intervention methods and skills to unleash the potential of whole organizational systems by transforming an organization's culture.

GBUS 8610,"This course is designed primarily for students seeking a marketing career in organizations that market products and services to other organizations. While the course is aimed at those interested in business-to-business marketing, it is also appropriate for those seeking careers in consulting, manufacturing, and nonmarketing functional areas of business-to-business firms. The course emphasizes the tactical aspects of business marketing as well as conceptual and strategic elements of the marketing-planning process. The course begins by examining how to organize the marketing function and then moves to the topics of buyer-seller relationships, sales force management, complexities and problems inherent in forging longer term partnerships, and developing and managing complex distribution systems along with some exposure to product development and launch. Cases have been chosen from a variety of settings, ranging from high tech to 'metal bending' and from the emerging to the more mature businesses.

GBUS 8611,"The course is intended primarily for those who are considering careers with financial service organizations that serve as competitive financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks, investment banks, money managers, and insurance companies. The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."
GBUS 8612,"This course will expose students to the challenges managing the product and service development process in a corporate environment.

Interactive marketing is characterized by activities that address customers directly (usually through some form of response advertising) for the purposes of initiating an exchange as well as developing, managing, and exploiting a customer relationship. Interactive marketing encompasses aspects of direct mail, customer relationship management, and Internet marketing. The ability to communicate with individual customers often allows the marketer to measure and manage each customer relationship separately. The results of response advertising campaigns are also measurable, testable, and data-base driven, thus converting the abstract aspect of marketing into the universal language of numbers. The course includes exercises in which students have the opportunity to apply and test the principles of interactive marketing in simulated business environments."

GBUS 8730,"This course is an opportunity for students to get real-time experience in a guided setting about the way they form work relationships, observe interactions, think through difficult situations, and learn from the choices made. In this full-semester course, students prepare for the challenges posed by the increased use of teams in the workplace while working directly with first-year learning teams as the teams evolve throughout the first semester. The relationship formed with a student's first-year team and documented through weekly required observations becomes a live and continuing case throughout the term. The first part of the course focuses on the learning team's evolution, supplemented by ongoing delivery of relevant group theory. The second part of the course broadens the focus to include the contemporary issues and challenges of workplace teams, such as leading your group at work, managing coordinating teams in strategic alliances, and teaching others to be better team members. The course is most successful when students commit the time and energy needed to maintain weekly contact with their team and remain open to learning about themselves and others in the process."
GBUS 8750,"This course will focus on the major psychological issues that underlie and contribute to the effective and, at times, ineffective performance of people in managerial roles. It begins with the development of a model of personality. The initial development model is necessary for setting the stage for the remaining sessions of the course that build on and add to this framework. During the course, topics such as gender, race, meanings, habits of excellence, relationships, creativity, and life-long growth will be examined. Students also will consider those issues that, although not visible at first glance, prove to be at the heart of why things are the way they are and not what they initially seem. Interactive conversations around reading materials provide much of the activity of this course."

This is a course in strategy and entrepreneurship with three main themes: Creating and Realizing Value, Prioritizing Opportunities, and Managing the Innovation Process. Within these themes, students will explore why innovation is invention that creates value and why some inventions do not create value; why projects involving the innovation process are notoriously difficult to value: how to set priorities when choosing among innovation opportunities; how to guide early stage research efforts toward potentially distant products; why managing the process requires thinking about the unfolding and often nonlinear stages; how multiple dimensions cumulate in success or failure; how to think about the many uncertainties and manage the risks such as running out of cash; how to deal with the changes of course, challenges of competition, setbacks, and forward leaps in managing big, long-term innovation efforts; and, most importantly, how the outcomes of this process depend on the people involved. This course deals with both small and large corporations and usually encompasses a range of technologies."

This course and Management Decision Models are intended for students interested in further core Decision Analysis instruction and is designed for those students who were comfortable with Decision Analysis and wish to pick up where it left off without significant overlap. Students who feel the need for significant review and reinforcement of the Decision Analysis content with modest extensions will benefit from this course. Thus, those students who made an A or B+ in Decision Analysis probably will find that this course does not meet your educational objectives and should consider a course that is more appropriate. Please contact the instructor if you have questions in this regard."
GBUS 8930,"This course focuses on two-party negotiations in a wide variety of settings ranging from simple buyer-seller bargains to complex, multi-issue strategic relationships. Most class sessions revolve around the results of negotiations between class members that are conducted prior to class, as preparation for the session. The results of these negotiations are displayed each day and provide an opportunity for explicit feedback on each student's negotiating performance. Class discussion reviews the wide variety of experiences in the specific negotiation and develops and tests hypotheses regarding effective behaviors, tactics, and strategies. The resulting ideas are reinforced and further developed through a series of weekly readings. Finally, the course offers several frameworks for codifying each student's negotiation toolkit and for describing each student's negotiation behavior."
