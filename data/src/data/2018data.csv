Not only have I stressed with major but I've also learned lessons in love, friendship, and life in general. Love is bravery and understanding. Friendship is willing to hear and share life stories on the second floor of Ohio. Life is a balance - it is a fusion of pursuing your passion and feeling the world. 

My journey to finding my major is a zigzag one, but just because it has been difficult I have some advice to share. I wanted to do biomedical engineering - in fact, I submitted the eschool transfer request. However, I figured the practical part of me - the part that inherits from my father's businessman spirit - always asked me for more serious consideration. That was when I realized I could not possibly give up the little researcher inside of me either - the part of me that loves solving problems and pondering what I'm contributing to this world. That was the time when cs slipped in. If I were ever asked to give advice on how to choose a major, I'd say just one thing: get a better understanding of who you are.

I had friends who questioned things. I heard them questioning why we were even here, why UVA, why America, and I myself questioned as well. College students grow mature, and we grow mature with our eyes opened. Cultural identity induced an interesting pain I had. I suffered because I was trying to blend in both groups - my Chinese community and my western hallmates. In the end, I was grateful of this challenge that built me stronger and taught me to open my hearts to true friends regardless of their ethnicities.

Confused, passionate, heartbroken. Turbulent youth adds sadness to our brows, but that's when life is epic. Given my first year experiences, I'd Iove to have a mentee, give recommendations, and watch she/he grow.

My favorite professor in the comm school. The way he teaches finance is by relating the theory to current events, and showing you all the intricacies in a case that looks simple at the first sight. The way he dresses is also charming.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But thanks to the internet, I got to know many valuable opportunities and was admitted to one of the most prestigious programs, Summer Science Program, which was a life-changing experience for me. When I got back, I held an information session at our school to introduce this to students and offered tutoring for application if needed. I love what Michelle Obama once said in her speech: “when you’ve walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you. You reach back and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed.” That’s what I’ve learned after being in a small yet tight community and having received helps from all kinds of people around me.

I love the concept of MSN: bringing Chinese students together, exploring our identity and helping each other succeed. I want to become a mentor to help foster a united and strong community where everyone could flourish.","Don't be afraid of stepping out of your comfort zone. ","","Political Philosphy, Policy and Law","ECON 2010: Intro to MicroEcon","Prof. Elzinga","I won't say it is an easy A class. This class seems really easy at the beginning, but the final is tricky. I went through the study guide and practice questions but still found that there were questions from the final that had not been covered in the discussions or the lectures. And don't rely on the dutch knockout. A lot of people thought they could use the dutch knockout, but the final was more difficult than they imagined so it turned out they still had to use the 400 scale. Got an A-. Definitely a GPA killer for me. Don't really recommend this class unless you have to take it. Prof. Elzinga is a really nice person though.","ARTS 2610: Intro to Drawing ","Prof. Bernstein ","LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Prof. Bernstein is one of the best professors I had. She has a special approach for teaching. She is more focused on your progress instead of one particular drawing. A lot of us came to class and knew nothing but drawing, but she has been very patient and kept saying how amazing our works all were. I am grateful I had her. Lowkey telling you I heard other professors are kinda mean and give a lot of work... ","RELJ 3490 Jewish Wedding ","Prof. Ochs ","LOVE LOVE LOVE! The class is so interesting and Prof. Ochs is one of the best professors I have had so far. She is super nice and patient, and will take your year, your experience with religious studies and so forth into consideration when grading. That being said, she focuses more on your overall progress and the efforts you put into. Some people are unsatisfied with the grading. In my perspective, you don't really need to know how exactly every assignment is weighted because overall you only have three assignments, which means you need to pay attention to every assignment and really do it. The most important one is the midterm assignment. I spent 1.5 hr everyday doing that for almost a month before it was due. Many thought it was a fun and easy A class, but the truth is it is very interesting but not necessarily an easy A. I would recommend it to those who are interested in the subject matter and who are willing to spend time on it. ","FORU 1500 Creativity ","Prof. Ochs and Prof. Misliuk","I am part of the Creative Processes forum and this class is our required class for the first semester. I really love the nature of the class. We had many fun activities, such as dancing together, acting, walking around the classroom in different speeds, and making weird poses. We had guest speakers for every class. As for the workload, basically you need to write a response every week, reflecting on what you have learned in class and connecting it to the old materials. There is a 5-page midterm paper on what you have learned so far. The final is similar. Since it is a ""creative"" class, I guess everyone got an A in the end. ","EDIS 2010 Intro to teaching ","Prof. Wilson","A solid easy A class. You get full credits as long as you do the work. Quality doesn't matter.
