Today many writers speak of a 21st century 'sustainability revolution' which aims at: 1) 'correcting' the negative environmental consequences of the industrial revolution, 2) continuing with but redefining 'economic growth', and 3) moving beyond the relatively narrow concerns of late 20th century 'environmentalism' by integrating environmental issues into issues of social and economic justice.  All this means addressing not only such traditional 'environmental' problems as preserving biodiversity, upgrading air and water quality, and countering global warming, but also addressing such 'non-environmental' questions as how best to defend human rights, create an alternative to 'consumerism', restructure the contemporary corporation, combat pandemics like HIV/AIDS, alleviate  'world hunger', reform energy policies,  and assess the welcome and unwelcome consequences of  both globalization and nationalism.

GBUS7380 The purpose of this course is to enable students to reason about the role of ethics in business administration in a complex, dynamic, global environment. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think deeply about the nature of business, the responsibilities of management, and how business and ethics can be put together. Cases without easy answers that raise a range of problems facing managers in the contemporary business environment will be used. Discussions will focus on developing a framework for analyzing the issues in moral terms and then making a decision and developing a set of reasons for why the decision was justified. Students will be pushed to think carefully about how they make decisions and develop their capacity to defend their decisions to other stakeholders. This is important as a way not only to foster integrity and responsible decision making, but also to push students to take leadership roles in dealing with complex and difficult choices they will face in their careers. Operating from a managerial perspective, students will address a range of themes in the class, including basic concepts in ethics, responsibilities to stakeholders and the building blocks of markets, corporate culture, the sources of ethical breakdowns in organizations, managerial integrity, value creation, and personal values and managerial choice.

GBUS7600 This course is designed for the student who wants to be optimally prepared to perform quantitative analysis at a level consistent with (and exceeding) expectations for MBA interns in positions where quantitative sophistication is required. Its only prerequisite is the first-year Decision Analysis course; no additional quantitative experience or acumen is required. The course will focus primarily on data analysis, used to both gain useful insights into relationships and make better, more useful forecasts. In addition to more advanced treatment of regression analysis (the goal being for students to be able to build and apply sophisticated regression models), students will become familiar with other common approaches to forecasting, such as rudimentary time-series analysis. Students will also improve their ability to structure, analyze, and manage situations involving uncertainty and risk, using simulation (Crystal Ball), decision trees, and the other tools introduced in the required Decision Analysis course. Finally, the course will introduce students to the concepts of optimization using Excel's Solver add-in, used to determine how to optimally allocate resources in situations involving complex trade-offs.
GBUS7601 This course is intended to provide students with a comprehensive conceptual and applied understanding of our society's accounting and financial reporting system and an in-depth look at the numerous factors that managers and executives must consider as they confront complex and difficult financial accounting and reporting issues. Students will examine significant financial accounting and reporting issues from both a rigorous theoretical perspective and an informed practical perspective. Students will explore such traditional issues as revenue recognition, inventory valuation, and leases, and such contemporary issues as mergers and acquisitions, intangibles, and financial derivatives. Although the primary focus of the course will be on accounting and reporting practices in the United States, students will also address selected differences between U.S. accounting standards and international accounting standards. How the major accounting scandals that have occurred in recent years have affected the financial reporting process and those who have the responsibility for insuring the accuracy of a company's published financial statements will also be addressed. [l1] By the conclusion of this course, students should be reasonably proficient at understanding, interpreting, and analyzing the information contained in corporate financial statements and their related footnotes, and also be able to assess the overall quality of a company's financial reporting, identify the critical accounting policies, and make an assessment regarding the reasonableness of those policies and their supporting estimates and judgments.
GBUS7602 This course emphasizes the development of technical skills that enable students to improve their understanding of global financial markets. The course focuses on the key drivers of movements in currency and interest-rate markets around the world, as well as the important institutions and players that impact those markets. Students will examine how interest rates are impacted by such factors as central-bank behavior, fiscal policy, the state of the business cycle, productivity, inflation expectations, and international capital flows. For currencies, students will develop two related tool kits: one that is useful for understanding the drivers of orderly changes in exchange rates, and a second, through the construction of an early-warning system, that focuses on factors associated with large and potentially disorderly depreciations. Students will also investigate ways in which firms and investors manage interest-rate and currency exposure, as well as how countries manage exchange rates. The course, which includes both technical readings and cases, should appeal to a broad array of students, especially those who wish to pursue careers in investment banking, international finance, and general management.
GBUS7603 This course focuses on how financial assets and firms are valued in financial markets. It directly extends and strengthens the corporate finance principles from the required first-year Financial Management and Policies course by applying valuation models to real financial data and assets. The course contains three modules: firm-valuation techniques, option-pricing principles, and fixed-income valuation. The first module extends the first-year finance course by considering more difficult firm valuations as well as alternate techniques for valuing firms. The second and third modules relate to the capital markets for which valuation principles from options and fixed-income instruments are used as building blocks to decompose the valuation of complex financial instruments.
GBUS7604 The aim of this course is to help students have confidence in their unique perspectives and to develop leadership communication skills that fully, creatively, and effectively express their insights. Topics introduced in the required Management Communication course, communication strategy, credibility, storytelling, persuasion will be further examined, specifically in the context of oral communication. .
GBUS7605 Expanding on the model of first semester Management Communication, this course emphasizes how general managers can, through communicating with a consideration of changing contexts, further an organization's strategy and remove obstacles to implementing that strategy. Students will explore how in today's rapid pace of change in communication technology, the corporate communication function must communicate authentically to and align messages with all stakeholders while managers at every level will be increasingly expected to clearly articulate corporate strategy and goals. Many internships end with a presentation or report and seek three capabilities: mastery of key MBA concepts, solving an enterprise level problem, and superior communication skills. By moving from analysis to articulation and implementation, the communication perspective is especially suited to integrating key concepts in order to solve larger analytical problems. This class will use cases as a basis for such daily exercises as media training, financial conference calls, and action plan pitches and will conclude with a substantive presentation driven by student interests.
GBUS7606 This course is designed to familiarize students with the market research tools and techniques commonly used by Darden students in marketing internships and graduating students who pursue careers in marketing. The course will cover the basic techniques for market sizing and expose students to important sources of secondary marketing information. It also will cover a number of important primary research topics, including questionnaire design, focus groups, perceptual mapping, conjoint analysis, and market experiments. Course content will feature a combination of cases, exercises, lectures, and a group project. The market intelligence topics will be addressed in the context of important marketing issues such as positioning, target market selection, assessing brand meaning, value pricing, and evaluating communication effectiveness. The emphasis in the course is on the planning and design of gathering marketing intelligence and basic level analysis. Advanced techniques in data analysis will be taught in the Marketing Analytics course.
GBUS7607 This course prepares first-year students for their summer internships. Using full-length feature films, the course shows students how to get the most out of their summer internships and, in the process, teaches them career-management skills that will help them become more effective leaders in their careers after Darden. The course addresses critical well-researched joining-up phenomena such as letting go of the current engagement, establishing credibility, learning organizational norms, socialization, self-management, the locus of control, the effects of compromise, joining work groups and teams, adult-learning theory, orientation to hierarchy and power distance, managing upward, abrasive personalities, and consolidating experience-based learning. It is designed to capitalize on the literature and research bases provided by neurolinguistic programming, habitual behavior, and rational-emotive-behavior constructs in order to ensure that students will fit in quickly, gain influence rapidly, learn consistently, and outperform their competition. The provocative films encourage student engagement and, perhaps, life-changing debate.
GBUS7608 This course addresses topics and subjects likely to be experienced by MBAs seeking positions or internships in general-management career-development programs or consulting firms with a strong interest in good operations-analysis/management skills. The topics covered in this course are likely to be encountered by rising MBA students in their summer internships or by recent graduates in their first few years out of school. Topics will include, but will not be limited to, such areas as competitive cost analysis, lean thinking in services and manufacturing, and six-sigma project design and implementation.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS7609 This course is about learning to think and act entrepreneurially in order to create new value in the world through new products, new solutions, new ventures, new business units, new distribution channels, new firms, new business models, new technologies, and business transformation. The emphasis will be on the art and science of 'creating something new from little.' The orientation in the course will be to challenge students to think about how they can create, finance, and build or change a productive business organization with commonly available resources (e.g., intelligence, insight, energy, initiative, and personal relationships). Students will learn to use this orientation wherever new-venture creation may occur, namely, through the actions of an independent entrepreneur or in a large, established firm.
GBUS7610 The first six to eight sessions of the course examines the process of creating value for multiple stakeholders and focuses on business models that 'make a difference' by combining traditional value for financiers with the broader concept of value for stakeholders (including financiers). Pre-requisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS7611 This course is intended to introduce students to the consulting process and to help them identify and refine the skill sets necessary for successful consultation. The course is designed specifically for students interested in pursuing consulting internships and careers but who do not have significant consulting experience prior to Darden. Approximately half of the course will focus on the cognitive processes involved in framing and designing the engagement specifically, hypothesis generating and testing, using a set of video cases that track the work of actual consulting teams as they move through the processes of initiating and completing client projects. The other half will address a more tactical set of issues around engagement work-planning, data-gathering, field-interviewing, and communicating with clients. The course will include the use of cases and exercises and the completion of a final project presentation. Students will be assigned to a consulting team to work with throughout the course.
GBUS7612 By exploring in more depth the strategies of communication framed in the First-Year Management Communication course, this course offers students the opportunity to obtain the polished presentation skills, particularly oral, so necessary for a successful career.

GBUS7618 Through a combination of cases and experiential exercises this course brings to students what expert entrepreneurs have learned the hard way. Expert entrepreneurs are people who have built multiple ventures including successes and failures and taken at least one company public.
GBUS7619 Power, status, and influence are topics that make many people somewhat uncomfortable. However, they are fundamental realities in much of organizational life and are the mechanisms by which things get done. Being an effective leader and change agent requires both understanding power and acting on that knowledge. This class is about power: how things get done, how to build and wield influence, and the multiple ways to accomplish these objectives.
GBUS7620 This course looks at the barriers that limit individual and institutional networks and explores the ways in which networks can be expanded and strengthened resulting in more effective interpersonal communications. Students will learn that managers who understand and identify such networks are better informed, more effective, and more influential in their positions. Also included in the course will be the study of interpersonal, social, and organizational networks, how they can be created, and why they are valuable. Although the course will build on a number of the concepts presented in First-Year Management Communication, including audience analysis and persuasion, it will focus most closely on the role that storytelling plays in network creation and expansion. Instructional methodologies are a balance of cases and presentations, along with technical readings where appropriate. Leveraging our diverse community, role playing, impromptu speeches, narratives, more formal presentations, and some short written work will be used to build the skills necessary for effective networks. Students may choose a final presentation and paper to complete the course.

GBUS8018 The United States and many other countries face a trio of inequalities: income, wealth, and opportunity. While income inequality is a well-accepted result of a capitalist economy, the degree of inequality has been steadily increasing since 1979. Many including Nobel Prize winning economists Robert Schiller and Joseph Stiglitz state that economic inequality is the defining challenge of our time.
GBUS8019 Seasoned leaders will tell you that there were defining moments - those particular instances in which their values and judgment were tested in an inescapable way - that played a disproportionate role in how they and others thought about their success. Navigating these defining moments well usually requires strong communication. Economists Robert Schiller and Joseph Stiglitz state that economic inequality is the defining challenge of our time.
GBUS8020 This course examines the contemporary practice of corporate communication, which has been defined by one practitioner as 'the clear articulation of corporate strategy and goals internally and externally as well as the understanding and removal of issues blocking the implementation of that strategy.' The course focuses on recent developments in corporate communication and the way intangible assets increasingly provide companies with competitive advantage and a key hedge against risk. Students will explore the ways in which corporate communications align key messages to multiple stakeholders and assist in the management of crises; the process of building reputation and corporate brand; the reasons why new information about the impact of communication enhances the quality of managers' decision-making ability; and how the growing role of corporate citizenship and environmental sustainability in corporations plays a significant, if sometimes controversial, part in managing reputation. At no time in the recent past have so many issues threatened corporate reputation. Therefore, the area of corporate communication is particularly relevant to all future managers. Students will respond in writing to one of the course readings, present on a current topic derived from course themes, and provide a writing assignment or CD based on their presentation.
GBUS8021 This course is designed to identify the fundamental communication skills required to introduce innovations, either within large corporations or in new start-ups. The premise of the course is that the best ideas in the world will remain unrealized without the entrepreneur's ability to communicate the elements of his or her business model so that vision, strategy, and tactics become clear to business partners and investors.

GBUS8033 The digital marketing course prepares students for the variety of ways interactive communication and positioning may be part of their future careers whether they are CMOs thinking strategically or CEOs asking the right questions of an ad agency. Interactive technology is driven by innovation, making it difficult to study one text or conclude that one static model works best.
GBUS8038 The Equities course is designed for students interested in a career in investment management. The primary purpose of the course is to teach students how to value publicly traded equities. The valuation tools considered begin with the discounted cash flow and multiples techniques introduced in First Year Financial Management and Policies and the elective, First Year Valuation in Financial Markets. These techniques are augmented with other approaches as explained by a series of practicing money managers and equity analysts who serve as guest lecturers throughout the course. The course is premised on the assumption that the stock market is efficient overall but that valuation for certain equities varies at times from the true intrinsic value. In such a market, the careful application of fundamental analysis can uncover overvalued and undervalued companies. Similarly, the course entertains the application of technical analysis as a method for interpreting market psychology and its influence upon stock valuation over time. In addition to the specifics of valuation, the course explores the ways that these tools are used to value stocks.

GBUS8090 This course covers the topics with which boards of directors and CEOs most commonly deal. The course begins with coverage of the legal obligations which directors must fulfill such as planning for the selection of the CEO, appraising CEO performance, organizing an orderly and timely succession, and insuring that management development and succession planning permeate the top three levels of the organization. The general topic of management compensation will be covered including management contracts, parachutes, non-compete agreements, salary systems, various incentive systems, and the roles and merits of stock options and restricted stock, as well as how corporate and business unit strategies and operating plans must be approved and monitored. Students will examine a board's involvement in decisions about issuing debt or equity, paying dividends, or repurchasing stock, as it meets its fiduciary role with regard to management, internal auditors, internal controls, the SEC and other required reporting, legal liabilities, and payment of taxes. The course examines how boards monitor and approve corporate and business unit strategies and operating plans to insure compliance with the foreign corrupt practices acts, OSHA, EPA, and EED, among others, and how the boards deal with a number of external events, including hostile takeover attempts, stockholder activism, proxy fights, class-action suits, derivative-action suits, and business disasters. Finally, the course covers processes for reviewing the performance of individual directors, the board, and the CEO.
GBUS8106 This course focuses on the process of acquisition of a business entity. Students will be shown the tools they need and the process to follow to successfully acquire a business of their own. Among the major topics covered will be the search process, assessing and valuing the business, financing consideration, negotiating, and closing the deal.

The learning process will be highly experiential as students work in groups to develop a viable new product or service via a hands-on team project. Each team of students will identify market (user) needs, develop alternative product or service concepts to meet those needs, flesh out the concepts through a process of iterative design.
GBUS8150 Building on the First Year Strategic Thinking in Action course, which covers mostly business-level strategy, this course addresses two issues in strategy: the role of acquisitions and diversification in corporate strategy and the achievement of merger objectives (usually, synergies) after the deal is done. Students will tackle the challenges and problems most businesses encounter in integrating acquisitions with the understanding that according to research 65% to 85% of most mergers fail. Students also will learn how to distinguish between different types of mergers and to discern the appropriate tools required for integrating two or more separate organizations. By the end of the course, students should be able to contribute to any post-merger-integration-strategy consulting engagement, corporate development activities, and M&A practices. Instruction for the course consists of cases, exercises, and a variety of readings from business and history.
GBUS8160 Students who seek careers in investment banking, venture capital, corporate finance, and management consulting will find this course of interest. Although students pursuing these career paths do not need tax expertise, they do need to be able to evaluate critically when to call in the tax experts and what the tax experts are telling them. Therefore this course provides a general understanding of the basic tax consequences of fundamental restructuring strategies and a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes have in these strategies. The course requires students to analyze how tax consequences affect the value of different strategies to the buyer and seller. Understanding the effect of taxes on the value of a deal to the buyer and seller prepares future financial executives and strategic advisors to make better decisions and to be more effective negotiators. Although the course focuses on the tax consequences of restructuring strategies and their valuation implications, it also covers the nontax advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. Most of the course covers U.S. federal income tax issues of restructuring of C corporations, but it also will address pass-through entities. Other topics will be entity formation, taxable asset and stock acquisitions, tax-free asset and stock reorganizations, and divestitures and liquidations. The principal modes of instruction are cases, readings, articles, exercises, and a group project that allows students to investigate a specific deal of personal interest.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.

GBUS8173 The course will explore several of these issues and markets in detail and students will be gaining insight on how global markets function, what kinds of factors impact them, who the key players are, and what their role is. The course will also seek to explore sector/industry specific learnings in areas such as, for example, real estate, shipping, hedge funds, and private equity.
GBUS8174 We live in an increasingly globalized world, yet globalization is under attack in many countries. Has globalization gone too far? There is Brexit, rising economic nationalism in Europe and the United States, and we hear calls for far-reaching protectionism against Mexico and China by the Trump administration. It is time to reconsider the institutions of globalization (WTO, IMF, WB) and the role that international trade, migration, outsourcing
GBUS8180 Immense amounts, granularity of data, the pervasiveness and speed of computing power with mobility make analytics a competitive advantage.

GBUS8190 This course is about blending finance, tax law, accounting, and strategy in the analyses of high-value-added business decisions. This course is not about: tax compliance (the correct way to file tax returns), tax complexity (finding loopholes), tax minimization (beating Uncle Sam), or tax evasion (filing illegal returns). Students are provided with a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes, which directly or indirectly pervade most business transactions, have in business decisions. Students will explore how taxes affect a variety of fundamental business issues such as forming a company, compensating employees, attracting investors, and positioning worldwide operations. While the topics deal primarily with U.S. income taxes, the course's conceptual framework applies irrespective of time and jurisdiction. Students seeking careers in entrepreneurship, management consulting, investment banking, venture capital, or industry, especially general management, corporate finance, or accounting, will find this course of interest. No prior knowledge of taxation is required. The principal modes of instruction are cases, articles, and the group project that enables each student to tailor the course to address an area of personal interest.
GBUS8203 The purpose of this course is to deepen students' understanding of the role of ethics in management. The course builds on the conversations begun in the First Year Business Ethics course and addresses several key themes of interest for contemporary managers.
GBUS8210 The primary objective of the course is to allow students to walk a few steps in the shoes of an entrepreneur while learning how expert entrepreneurs build new ventures that endure. Cases, guest lecturers, and students' project work will allow them to explore financial, legal, interpersonal, and personal challenges likely to be encountered by the independent entrepreneur. This course draws from cognitive science-based research on how expert entrepreneurs think, decide, and act while starting new ventures. Key issues addressed will include risk perception and management, formulation of innovative stakeholder relationships, and the creation of new markets through new ventures. As part of the course, students will be required to come up with a venture idea and take the initial steps in actually starting it. The course is recommended for those interested in initiating a personal venture at some point in their lives working with or consulting for an early stage entrepreneurial team or seeking entry into Darden's Progressive Incubator.
GBUS8220 This course focuses on the process of acquisition of a business entity. Students will be shown the tools they need and the process to follow to successfully acquire a business of their own.

GBUS8230 This course provides students with an opportunity to understand business opportunities and challenges from the hands-on perspective of the owner/general manager of a smaller enterprise. Although many MBA's are deciding that they would rather lead in smaller businesses than follow in large ones, by the end of this course they will see that 'a smaller business is not a little big business' and that managing a smaller enterprise is an art related to, but substantially different from, managing a large corporation. In the course, students will discover that the issues, challenges, and perspectives differ as much as the numbers in the financials as well as what happens after the start-up or acquisition of a firm. Typical issues addressed are finding a job with a smaller enterprise, the characteristics of the smaller enterprise, creating value as a smaller enterprise CEO, management transitions associated with stages of small business growth, challenges of finding, retaining, and losing employees, special issues and considerations in the family-owned business, franchising as a financing and growth mechanism, import-export operations and international dimensions of small business, ethical challenges of everyday life in the small firm, the balancing act of personal, family, and business realities of the smaller firm, and exiting a venture on your terms.
GBUS8234 Innovation will become a strategic necessity for every organization in the Digital/ Smart Machine Age. Innovation excellence requires an Innovation System- the right people in the right environment using the right processes. Innovation is hard both from an organizational and individual perspective. This course focuses on how to create an Innovation System and how to become an excellent innovator and innovation team leader.
GBUS8235 Economics of Strategy uses the tools of price theory to examine strategic problems. Forces of supply (costs) and demand (benefits) at the levels of the firm and the market, and equilibrium models that reflect the nature of competitive interactions, provide the conceptual framework.  The roles of non-market institutions, including governments and the courts, and their implications for firm strategy, are incorporated into the framework.
GBUS8240 The purpose of these courses is to expose students to a wide range of ideas about the practices of management from various points of view, both ancient and modern. The examples of management behavior and effectiveness studied range from outstanding to mediocre and from highly ethical to scurrilous. Students are responsible for reading one book a week chosen from the areas of management classics, classics of civilization, or current management thought and then preparing a one-page paper detailing their opinions about the book and any lessons contained therein. Seminar members meet in discussion groups to compare their thoughts and impressions. By practicing critical evaluation of and reflection on the works and engaging each other and faculty in intense, small group discussions of the concepts, students will be prepared to draw on a wide base for ideas when they face the complex and volatile work environment after graduation. The seminar participants include students and faculty from the Darden School along with interested University of Virginia alumni.

GBUS8270 This seminar on leadership and management examines the life work of Thomas Jefferson by studying the many roles he played in the founding of our country. The basic scheme of the seminar dictates that the students read a book a week, write a one-page paper each week summarizing their impressions from the readings, and then engage in a discussion about their thoughts on leadership and management as related to the readings. The seminar meets in the Colonnade Club Pavilion on the Lawn at the University of Virginia, a setting that contributes to a means for Darden students to obtain a greater understanding of the culture and traditions of Mr. Jefferson's University. Reading selections are taken from the six-volume biography on Thomas Jefferson written by Dumas Malone, the book Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose, the book Founding Brothers by Joseph Ellis, the book John Adams by David McCullough, and the two prize-winning films on Jefferson by Ken Burns. The seminar participants include students and faculty from the Darden School along with interested University of Virginia alumni.
GBUS8280 This course introduces students to selected areas of business law of particular relevance to general managers and their financial advisers, excluding tax law. The focus is less on the substance of particular legal rules, for which managers rely on their legal advisers, and more on the basic tools of legal analysis. This knowledge adds value in two respects. First, it facilitates communication with lawyers and understanding the advice they provide. Second, it demonstrates a way of analyzing problems that is different from, but complementary to, those taught in core business courses. The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts. It then moves to substantive areas that managers routinely encounter, such as corporate governance, bankruptcy, intellectual property, and antitrust. The course examines the structure of the court systems and legal profession in the United States and provides some comparative analysis of other legal systems. Students learn to read and understand basic primary legal materials and recognize standard analytical techniques.
GBUS8290 Many of our most successful entrepreneurial companies have been founded and significantly influenced by professional venture-capital firms. This course focuses on the professional world of venture capitalists and how venture capitalists work with entrepreneurs to create substantial, enduring ventures.

Students will be organized into six groups for research activities and presentations.
GBUS8303 This course explores investment and valuation issues that are unique to emerging economies. These economies, with low per capita income, will likely provide substantial growth opportunities for global investors. Students will learn that the risks of investing in these economies are not only substantial but also different from those in developed economies.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden Students
GBUS8304 Because business success begins with understanding what consumers want and need and ends with consumer satisfaction, a clear understanding of consumer psychology is essential to successful marketing. This course examines the basic concepts of consumer psychology and the application of those important concepts to marketing decisions. The goal of this course is to introduce students to these important concepts and, unlike the course in consumer marketing, focus on the factors that drive the consumer decision-making processes in order for students to understand how marketing strategies and tactics can affect those processes. Topics covered include the formation of attitudes, the role of self-image in consumer behavior, understanding emotions and how they affect decision making, memory formation, and certain biases that emerge and influence strategies and the mechanisms by which they work. The course is built on a lecture and discussion format.
GBUS8306 This course explores the multiple ways that an individual, company, or corporation can participate in ventures that impact social and/or environmental issues while simultaneously focusing on financial goals. Through direct dialogue and interaction with guests, students will query, discuss, and argue answers to questions such as: What is corporate responsibility and should it be discussed? What is the role of leadership in social responsibility? Can you do 'good' in your business and still make money? Are Corporate 500 companies responsible and how, why, and who? How is social responsibility operative in environmental programs, energy development, micro-lending, civil societal issues, and marketing?
GBUS8307 This is a course designed for those who intend to work in consumer marketing, advertising, consulting, or retailing.

Enrolling students should have a clear commitment to a practical leadership experience during their second year. Selected readings in the leadership and social psychology literature serve as frameworks for examining one's personal leadership style. Prerequisite: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8309 This course explores the relationships among domestic and foreign firms in economic development, particularly in emerging economies. Concerns over the distribution, pace, and consequences of economic growth are a fundamental force driving change in the international business environment. Firms and their managers are heavily influenced by these changes and by government policies that seek to improve economic conditions through increased flows of trade and investment. Investments in developing economies in particular present managers with opportunities to realize substantial financial returns and contribute to economic growth but are fraught with unique challenges and risks. Investments by foreign firms also raise normative concerns regarding the role of business in society and the nature of globalization. The course gives students theories and frameworks for understanding the nature of economic development and growth and the effects of private firms' trade and investment activities on local economies. By applying these frameworks to a broad set of cases, students learn how to analyze the economic, financial, and social relationships influencing investments and operations around the globe. All the materials and experiences in the course speak to the central question: 'How do firms affect globalization and economic development, and how do globalization and economic development affect firms?'
GBUS8310 This advanced strategy seminar provides class participants with an integrative framework and specific analytical tools for understanding how firms interact in the marketplace: within an industry, across industries, and beyond national borders. The premise of the course holds that business competition is both dynamic and relative; it is a constant interplay between companies as they juggle market positions by exchanging moves and countermoves, and a firm initiating a competitive move (whether a new product introduction or expansion into a new market, an acquisition bid or a simple price cut) must be prepared to meet counteractions from rivals. Understanding the relative nature of this dynamic process is the key to building and sustaining competitive advantage. The seminar is designed to develop an appreciation for cutting-edge academic research and its application to pertinent competitive issues, which is an essential skill for managers responsible for developing and implementing business strategies and for consultants advising such managers. Participants will be expected to abstract larger strategic issues from financial and operational particulars and to apply the concepts, analytical tools, and research methods learned in class to an intensive project on competition. The course will be especially useful to those interested in strategy consulting, marketing and strategic planning, and industry security analysis, as well as anyone seeking to develop sophisticated competitive thinking.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8330 The purpose of this course is to equip students to be the type of managers who understand government processes, are politically aware, are mindful of the interaction between media, government, and business and appreciate how business can gain strategic advantage by monitoring and working with government at all levels. The course will prepare students to meet these managerial requirements and to participate in complex decisions when changing laws, regulations, and other governmental factors that have major long-term implications. In addition to case situations and readings on current issues, selected speakers from business and government will add their expertise.
GBUS8375 The course will integrate concepts and theories from History, Politics, and Management as a starting point for studying the development of a Presidential administration in its social, political and cultural contexts. Lessons learned from the past and parallels to the present have great relevance to our future.
GBUS8376 The course will integrate concepts and theories from History, Politics, and Management as a starting point for studying the development of a Presidential administration in its social, political and cultural contexts. Lessons learned from the past and parallels to the present have great relevance to our future.
GBUS8400 Situations requiring action vary in complexity and scope. The decision settings include a rich variety of dilemmas general managers inevitably face. This course focuses on general managers and the requirement that they take action in situations, which vary in complexity and scope. General Managers are defined as those managers who possess profit and loss responsibility at any level of the organization from first-level product-line managers to chief executive officers. General Managers must also manage the interfaces of the functional departments: marketing, operations, finance, and engineering or R&D. The goal in each class is for students to develop a plan of action and to think through the detailed steps, which would be needed to implement their plans. Students should be prepared to use current management tools, tried and true management philosophies, and all of the multidisciplinary tools they have internalized in their MBA education when deciding how to take action. The course requires students to capitalize on their entire Darden experience and polish their enterprise perspective.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8401 This course is open to students who have accepted summer employment in a country other than that of their permanent residence. It allows students to use their summer-employment experience as a way to increase their knowledge of a culture other than their own and address the challenges of working in that culture. Course content will involve preparation at the beginning of the summer when students will plan a program of readings and discussions supervised by a faculty member and make a personal statement of the learning expectations they have for this summer activity, a midsummer report about what they are experiencing. At the end of the summer, students will engage in a class discussion based on each student's in-class report about a significant and surprising aspect of their cultural experience and what was learned from it. Students also will be expected to write a final report reviewing their cultural experience and the extent to which their learning expectations were achieved. The report should also compare and contrast their job experience with what they might have experienced in their country of permanent residence.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8402 This course is designed to bring together health care leaders in a multidisciplinary effort to address critical issues and challenges facing health care. Students will explore how the economic, financial, and ethical issues cannot be treated separately in analyzing health care markets as the various sectors of the health care industry are interrelated. The course will develop a framework for understanding and evaluating the trade-offs that are inherent in the health care industry, and how these trade-offs affect strategic thinking. Topics will include health care financing, delivery, and strategy; current trends in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; medical devices; health care technology; and issues in public health policy. Students will examine these topics from a global as well as a United States perspective. Successful entrepreneurs and seasoned executives will participate in the class sessions to share their experience, opportunities, and advice.
GBUS8403 The purpose of this course is to build leadership skills and ethical analysis skills by reading, discussing, and performing dramatic scenes from great plays. The scenes will be chosen for their relevance to both leadership and ethics. The course is built around the conceptual apparatus in Dunham and Freeman (2000) that the task of the theatre director is akin to the task of the CEO. For example, students will examine how directors draw vision from particulars, emphasize good casting or 'getting the right people on the bus,' get the best out of their team, and approach work collaboratively. The class will examine theater companies as high-performance teams and attempt to construct such teams throughout the course. The course draws on the expertise of the artistic community in Charlottesville by providing several technical workshops on acting and directing.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8404 This course builds on the innovative trend toward service-related economies in the United States and other developed countries. In a participative seminar-like format, it uses student experiences and personal observation techniques along with cross-discipline outside speakers, cases, articles, and book selections.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8405 This course will help students prepare for the complexities of leadership and increase their general management skills during times of crisis. Students will analyze a variety of crises situations that affect businesses and other organizations and develop a set of crisis-leadership competencies. Both theoretical and applied/practical perspectives of crisis management will be addressed. Students will be exposed to multiple frameworks for managing crises and the tools and techniques for making sound leadership decisions before, during, and after crises hit. We will also examine crises as sources of organizational innovation and change. The course uses a variety of teaching methods, including case studies, current events, simulations, and guest speakers to illustrate key points and will draw on material from multiple functional areas including organizational behavior, strategy, marketing, and management communications. The course is particularly relevant to students preparing for the responsibilities of management and senior leadership.
GBUS8406 The purpose of this course is to explore issues and theoretical ideas in business ethics that were raised in the first-year course and to examine these issues and ideas in new contexts. There will be readings, cases, and books that are relevant to the topic at hand. Examples include Business Science and Ethics and Background Theories of Business Ethics, both of which explore the underlying philosophical theories behind much of the first-year course, and Topics in Ethics and Accounting and Finance, which explore issues around corporate governance. The content of the course will change based on student interest, external events that students would like to explore, and topics of interest to faculty and students.
GBUS8410 This course analyzes and applies tools and techniques to accounting data in order to derive measurements that aid in corporate valuation. Students will first develop a deeper understanding of accounting data by examining the incentives corporate officers face while making financial reporting choices as well as understanding the conceptual limitations of the financial reporting model.
GBUS8411 Graduating MBAs will spend the next 35 years of their lives working very hard. What is it they will be working for? To maximize their wealth? Fame? Happiness? Power? Peace of mind? Energy? Salvation or spiritual peace? To be loved? Friendship? A family? How do these all fit together in their definition of success and in what proportion? How do they avoid losing one for the sake of the other? This course will explore the pros and cons and the ins and outs of various answers to these and the fundamental question: 'What do you want?' and guide students on how not to become professional anecdotes for books such as Career Success, Personal Failure, and Must Success Cost So Much? The readings, films, film clips, and cases will be focused on related questions that examine the meaning of life, career, and the nature of success. Students can use this course to put their business educations in the context of managing their careers over their lifetimes before reentering the working world and actually experiencing the consequences of their decisions.
GBUS8414 This course is designed to assist students in their transition from the academic to the corporate environment. It will provide an opportunity for students to explore in more depth the strategies of communication framed in First Year Management Communication. It will offer students more practice in written and oral presentation work that will include frequent, individual meetings with the instructor for personal assessment and evaluation. The course will ask students to examine their personal communication styles including both their nonverbal behavior as well as how they express themselves in writing and in public presentations to both large and small groups. Areas examined in the course will be communication networks and organization channels, common barriers that lead to communication disruptions, the challenges of dealing with troubled and troubling constituencies, and specific communication frameworks that contribute to a vibrant corporate culture. More topics covered will be message structure strategies, the presentation development process, proposals, reports and business plans, customer and client meetings, communication audits and needs assessments, and communicating change and strategies for dealing with conflict and creating consensus.
GBUS8418 The course is intended to deepen students' understanding of links between global macroeconomic forces and their impact on financial markets. The cases cover major economic developments that have shaped the world financial system such as energy shocks, financial crises, and regime shifts in monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies. Historical lessons from the evolution of the global financial system will be offered and comparisons will be made with the current global environment for which extensive contemporary readings will be assigned and some outside speakers invited. The course is designed to provide students with the most up-to-date view on the forces that currently are shaping financial markets in developed and emerging economies. It will also provide a framework for students to make investment decisions in bond, equity, and currency markets that build upon the tools developed in First Year Global Economics and Markets.
GBUS8419 This course is focused on the application of legal and business knowledge to real world transactions in the international context. It is a practical course for students who are interested in applying their knowledge to deal structuring, identifying and resolving legal and business concerns, negotiations, documentation, and deal closing. This course is offered by the University of Virginia School of Law and the Darden School and will be taught as a seminar with a combination of students from both schools. The short-form cases or caselets often place students inside the negotiating room and challenge them to negotiate with foreign ministers, senior military officials, provincial governors, and other counterparties. Each case involves one significant cross-border transaction either successful or unsuccessful and will deal with specific issues such as deal structuring, negotiating, and documenting that arose during the course of that deal. Past cases have included situations in the countries of China's banking, Burma & Thailand's energy, Philippines's industry privatization, Indonesia's real estate, and China's IPO.
GBUS8420 This course is specifically focused on formulating and applying practical strategies for entering the markets of Asia Pacific, the highest growth region in the world. All of the case studies are based on the Asia Pacific region and many recount trail-blazing deals that offer innovative and useful lessons for students. Among the principal topics examined in the course are: Entry Strategies; Negotiating Strategies; Pricing Strategies; and Strategies for dealing with Governments and State-Owned Enterprises. The course is taught from the perspective of management strategy and decision making, but it is intended also to sharpen students' capabilities in deal structuring, financing, negotiating, and solving regulatory issues. In several cases, students will be placed at the negotiating table and have the opportunity to test their strategy against the local counterparty. Actual transaction outcomes and subsequent events are always presented. Past cases have included situations in the countries of China's automotive and chemicals, Pan-Asia's the Internet, Thailand's aircraft, Taiwan's consumer goods, and Hong Kong's managing feng shui.
GBUS8421 This course is intended for students interested in gaining insight into the issues and challenges of managing the development of new products and services in the corporate environment. A key feature of the course is its team-based field study of new product development in one of three industry settings: consumer products, defense/aerospace, or an industry of choice such as software development, medical/pharmaceutical, computers/electronics, or industrial components. Together with the field-study component that engages students in field-based research and discussions with senior industry executives leading new product creation, the course covers new product development practices via lectures, cases, and readings. Industry differences will be examined along dimensions including integration of customer understanding and input into product concept creation, leading innovation, R&D and engineering design practices, product portfolio management, effective use of the supply base, project personnel and leadership selection, performance management and incentives, integration between functional areas and development projects, and managing product roll-out in global markets. The course content will emphasize the management issues and trade-offs that are required to ensure that the product development process and decision-making values support the corporate strategy and functions within the corporation's constraints on both financial and human resources. The role of managers and leaders in support of product development are explored for those directly and indirectly involved in the new product development process.
GBUS8423 This course adopts the perspective of a CFO of a publicly held corporation as the strategic partner to the CEO with an emphasis on the role of financial analysis in creating corporate value. It draws heavily from analytical techniques provided in Financial Management and Policies and Valuation in Financial Markets courses and extends the concepts introduced in those courses to examine key policy challenges that confront public corporations.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8424 This course aims to sharpen the participants' strategic thinking. It examines competitive situations from a diverse range of corporate activities in which performance depends on the interactions between a multiplicity of decision makers, including customers, suppliers, competitors, employees, managers, investors, and regulators. Students will develop a tool set for perceiving, analyzing, and shaping these interactions. Most of the tools have first been developed in economic game theory. Many key insights from game theory are intuitively compelling and fit literally on the back of an envelope. The course therefore emphasizes concepts and qualitative reasoning, rather than quantitative techniques. Case studies from different functional areas serve to provide students with a store of strategic insights and, under the guidance of analytical tools, to condition sound intuitive thinking that will carry over to new, unfamiliar problems. Computer simulations enable hands-on decision making and provide feedback on the effectiveness of personal rules of thumb for competitive interactions.
GBUS8426 The Derivatives course is designed for students interested in a career in investment banking or corporate finance. The primary purpose of the course is to teach students how to interpret and value the wide variety of derivatives products available. As such, the course examines a broad array of derivative products that range from basic futures contracts to the more specialized products developed for interest-rate markets. The valuation tools considered begin with basic arbitrage relationships and from there students will develop the Black-Scholes model. The course will also introduce the binomial approach and will use it as the primary valuation framework throughout the course. Students will also, through the use of assignments and problem sets, develop an intuitive understanding of why these products are used and the fundamental relationships that underlay all derivative products.
GBUS8427 This course examines the entrepreneur as change agent within the evolving economy. Building on the premise that entrepreneurship presents the best contemporary outlet for agents of revolutionary change, students will examine how enterprising individuals create value for themselves and others, across regional, industrial, and social boundaries. This is a course for those whose long-term goals extend beyond creating personal economic gain and involve creating broad-scale value for multiple stakeholders. Although this course does not guarantee that every student will become a change agent or provide a step-by-step path for executing such change, our belief is that the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia corridor as an intersection of technology, capital providers, government agencies and officials, small and large firms, and universities provides a fertile environment for study. Therefore, the course will be delivered in-residence in the Washington metropolitan area.
GBUS8428 Investment decision makers often experience a tension between the decision rules commonly found in practice and those proscribed in theory. The resolution of this tension creates a dilemma for investment professionals. Some may choose to blindly accept theory and ignore the real-world realities of the market place. Others may choose to casually dismiss financial theory as unrealistic and irrelevant. Because either of these responses is likely to be perilous, this course seeks to fill the need for a more balanced response. Students may begin the course understanding that traditional finance theory relies on a set of fundamental assumptions about the behavior of buyers and sellers of financial securities and conditions of the market in which they trade. This course surveys areas of common departure from the traditional assumptions of investor behavior and market conditions with a view to evaluating their impact on investment decision rules.
GBUS8429 This course will provide a deeper understanding of options, preferred approaches and best practices in managing conflict, and leveraging consensus. As conflict is an inevitable element in all human relations, students will explore how managers and leaders who effectively deal with both daily and systemic conflict enjoy a distinct competitive advantage in a variety of respects. These include: building and maintaining strategic alliances and networks; furthering team creativity and innovation; fostering collaborative organizational cultures and working relationships; containing financial and human costs; and, ultimately, improving business results. While rooted in negotiation and conflict theory, this course will provide pragmatic and practical general management skills and should therefore be of interest to all students, regardless of their specific career or personal goals. Bargaining and Negotiating is a prerequisite for this course. Principal modes of instruction are cases, readings, extended simulations, and in-class exercises.
GBUS8430 Students who are interested in adding a dimension to their critical thinking and business design skills will be interested in this course during which they will examine fundamental skill sets that can accelerate their ability to diagnose and manage complex business issues. General managers and strategy consultants use system-thinking skills to examine the interconnectedness of business processes and policy structures and to judge how a change in any one area might affect the performance of an entire system over time. Students will learn a new approach to communicating with others and benefit from learning to utilize a system-design approach for facilitating discussions aimed at developing new mental models of complex business systems. During the course, students will utilize business simulations to design new managerial policies aimed at improving performance and testing alternative business scenarios. The course is highly participatory, relying on workshops, simulations, and interaction with classmates and guest speakers to complement readings, cases, and exercises. Throughout the course, special emphasis is placed on the ability to communicate with others to build a shared understanding of business processes, decisions, and business performance insights. Systems Design and Business Dynamics I may be elected without continuing on to Systems Design and Business Dynamics II, but part I is a prerequisite for part II.
GBUS8431 Systems Design and Business Dynamics I is a prerequisite for this course as part II is designed to allow students to apply the fundamental skills learned in part I to significantly more intricate business issues. Students will assess, quantify, and model the behavior of a complete system to determine effective points of leverage for achieving the business performance they select. More advanced system-analysis tools, design frameworks, and business simulations are offered to students who seek a differential capability in unraveling and addressing business-performance dynamics. Increasingly complex business situations are explored that are of particular interest to the strategic consultant, general manager, operations consultant, or market analyst. The course is highly experiential and participatory, relying on workshops, simulations, and interaction with classmates and guest speakers to complement the readings and cases. In addition to developing additional capability in analyzing business performance patterns, students will utilize mapping and modeling software to explore differences in strategic decision policies. Throughout the course, special emphasis is placed on the ability to communicate with others using system-analysis tools to build a shared understanding of business processes and insights. Part I is focused on individual work and exploration while this second part of the course engages students in more team-oriented work, and the class essentially becomes a set of small consulting firms whose purpose is to address intricate business issues.
GBUS8433 This course introduces students to the specific challenges of managing within the media, sports, and entertainment industries. The course also explores the management of businesses with a creative component, including topics such as how to deal effectively with advertising, public relations, or a talent agency, and better understanding those within an organization who create intellectual property (e.g., engineers designing cars and scientists researching breakthroughs in biotechnology). Students will discuss the challenges of communicating across boundaries to bridge the gap between the perceived 'creative' and 'business' functions. Cases studies will be utilized as well as projects designed either by the students themselves in a way that is helpful to their career or by guests involved in the course. The course will also stage creative encounters in which guests involved in media, entertainment, and sports engage students in the problems they face in their professional lives, encounters for which students will aim to find innovative solutions.
GBUS8434 This course explores the financial decisions of firms facing exchange risks in a global capital market. Building on students' existing understanding of exchange rate determinants, the course examines transaction and economic exposure, hedging activities, capital budgeting, global capital sourcing, and financial strategy.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8435 This course focuses on understanding what it means to advise, do business with, or be involved in the development of` a heavily regulated industry. It is aimed at attracting a group of interested students who believe they will be likely to have banking or consulting clients in the Life Sciences industry or who aspire to take a role in the creation of new enterprises in this sector. In this industry, whether Biotech or Devices, the consumer of products, the patient, does not choose the product, pay for it, or have any say about what products are available. This is a unique environment in which anyone involved needs to have a working knowledge of the philosophy, terminology, and processes their clients, companies, or products will have to follow. The course is not designed to make students regulatory experts but to show them ways to navigate the regulatory pathways and related issues, which impact every phase of the creation and growth of a Life Sciences company. For the most part, students will not examine the issues surrounding the growth of provider or service businesses such as hospitals but instead explore the issues related to businesses built around proprietary technology. Topic samples: the history and evolution of regulation in this country and why it has evolved differently in other countries; cosmetics, cosmeceuticals, and food and how these areas are coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators; how to finance a drug versus a device company; and emerging technologies' issues. Course content will include cases, class discussions, background reading, guest lectures, and individual and student team projects. Students will have an opportunity to follow an actual company's evolving strategy.
GBUS8438 This course provides an in-depth look at the emergence of experiences as a distinct form of economic commerce, using the book, The Experience Economy. Students will examine the ways marketing experiences are altering the methods with which companies create demand, the role of mass customization in shifting from goods and services to experiences, and how the staging of experiences requires fundamentally different human performance technologies. Students also will participate in a comprehensive review of nine analytical models. Each model is designed to foster robust thinking about experiential innovation and will be accompanied by a handful of typical examples, followed by open discussion and an interactive exercise aimed at making application to specific businesses and industries. At the conclusion of this review, teams will be formed with each team tasked with developing a case study or research report that utilizes a particular model to provide further exploration about creating value through new or enhanced experiences.
GBUS8439 This course uses business cases to explore leadership that is highly effective at building cultures of innovation. It focuses on how leaders can construct environments that encourage employees to search for innovative ways to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise, on a daily basis without external direction and instruction, and how these environments (cultures) can guide both strategic and executive decisions to optimize enterprise performance. It also demonstrates why innovation is increasingly important, not only to technology companies but also to companies across a broad spectrum of industries. Through business cases and filmed interviews, students will examine companies and leaders that have been successful at building cultures of innovation. The course is intended for students who seek to lead a business organization. It may also be useful for students wishing to pursue an investment career, as identifying leadership that creates cultures of innovation is believed by many to be a key ingredient in successful investing.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8440 This course explores the current state of affairs and aims to present a set of principles to guide the practicing manager and investor with respect to the effect of the intellectual property on strategic decisions. Changes in domestic and international policies toward granting patents have triggered massive shifts in managerial and investor behavior. Many companies now actively manage their patent portfolios as an extension of competitive strategy by engaging in risky, litigious, or otherwise aggressive actions. Still many others have yet to realize the importance of the changing patent environment and make suboptimal strategic decisions. Investors, striving to estimate the intrinsic value of firms, often face limited information and thus struggle with evaluating the importance of intellectual property to the overall strategic objectives of the company. In consequence, both corporate and investor decisions can vary dramatically from the optimum. The course will be conducted as a one-week course at Darden and in Washington D.C. and surrounding suburbs. It will entail speakers from and/or visits to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Senate, venture capital firms, and IP-intensive firms in Maryland and Northern Virginia. This course will be relevant to students anticipating careers in technology management, business strategy, consulting, venture capital, business development, financial reporting, and securities analysis.
GBUS8442 This course is intended for students who want to extend their knowledge and comprehensive understanding at both the conceptual and practical level of our accounting and financial reporting system beyond the topics covered in the prerequisite elective course, Financial Reporting and Analysis. It will provide students with new opportunities to take an in-depth look at challenging contemporary financial accounting and reporting issues and practices pertaining to inventory valuations, sales-type and operating leases, accounting changes, corporate restructurings, financial contingencies, mergers and acquisitions, and market valuations. Other topics covered will include earnings management, earnings per share, earnings quality, and corporate governance. The course also examines the impact that the recent accounting and related business scandals have had on investor confidence and the capital markets, and it includes a number of examples of fraudulent financial reporting that has occurred. Although the primary focus of this course is on accounting and reporting practices in the United States, it also addresses the significant progress made in establishing international financial reporting standards.
GBUS8443 This course gives second-year students an opportunity to learn the theory of effective mentoring and career coaching in the workplace and to apply it to real-life, professional-level discussions with first-year students in the MBA Career Development process. The course will prepare students to successfully meet the challenges of providing career counseling and direction to others for achieving superior performance in the workplace. Second-year coaches will study, practice, and reflect upon all aspects of coaching, mentoring, and counseling that fall within the scope of managerial responsibilities common to MBAs at various leadership levels. The course, which runs from August through March, will begin in a classroom setting where the theoretical aspects of coaching will be introduced and explored. Subsequent training sessions will be interspersed with hands-on application of the concepts with assigned first-year students. Throughout the course, direction and oversight will be provided by Career Development Center consultants both individually and in small groups with other coaches.
GBUS8444 This course will provide students with an understanding of the theory and practice of investment decision making. The course is divided into three modules: asset allocation, manager selection, and market frictions. The first module examines the decision of how to allocate a portfolio across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate).
GBUS8445 The Portfolio Management course is designed for students interested in careers in investment management. Students are required to have taken Valuation in Financial Markets (GBUS 7603) and Investments (GBUS 8444) prior to taking this course. The objective of the course is to help students develop the analytical tools and insight necessary to manage an investment portfolio.
GBUS8446 Whereas the prerequisite course GBUS 8060 is an introduction for those with little or no experience with innovation and sustainability, this new course provides students with the opportunity to go into significantly more depth regarding strategy design and implementation. It offers the opportunity for students with experience in sustainability and innovation topics to add greater depth to their practical understanding at the advanced level.
GBUS8447 This course will expose students to the managerial challenges that arise throughout the product and service innovation process, including needs identification, concept development via iterative design, and market launch. Using product development as a platform from which to launch a broader discussion on innovation, the course will investigate the key ingredients to successful innovations in any setting.
GBUS8448 This course is designed to explore what it means to be a person of faith and how that relates to how one should live, particularly in business. Students will look at this core question from the standpoint of three different religious traditions: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. As we look at each faith tradition, we will be asking a series of questions connected to core themes of the course.
GBUS8449 At the heart of this course is the phenomenon of the growing importance of women in leadership positions in corporate America and, to a lesser extent, in global corporations.
GBUS8450 The course gives students the opportunity to hear financial market experts discuss the most current financial issues in the headlines. Topics will span issues of concern to Wall Street as well as corporate America. Each class will feature a new speaker who will either introduce a new issue to the class or will bring a different perspective on the issue of a previous speaker.
GBUS8451 This course is intended for students whose careers will likely be affected by trends in international trade and investment. It offers a conceptual framework to analyze the opportunities and constraints of the global economy, while at the same time provides concrete examples of successful (or failed) business strategies. Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8452 This course is intended for those planning careers in areas not requiring a sophisticated knowledge of finance but who wish further exposure to operating finance from the general manager's perspective. The course will therefore touch briefly on topics of importance to those planning to work in marketing, operations, general management, smaller enterprises, and new ventures.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8453 This course explores a comprehensive set of financial situations that arise in high-growth and high-risk enterprises. It focuses primarily on the investment phase of the private equity cycle and examines the investment strategy, valuation, and structure of ventures in their formative stages prior to becoming public companies. A range of enterprises are examined from early stage (venture capital) to late stage (mezzanine financing and buyouts) to provide perspective on how the maturity of an organization influences the nature and structure of financing and valuation. Issues related to the measurement of returns in private equity funds, valuing enterprises at different stages of development, and structuring deals using various forms of financing are covered as well as the analytical methods to better measure performance and value enterprises. Students will examine how each party's view of the value of the enterprise forms a basis for negotiation upon which the percentage of equity participation and the terms of the contract are determined as well as how the pricing and terms depend not only the deal itself but also upon prevailing market conditions. As private equity firms are either rapidly growing or changing organizations, students will learn that there must be sufficient flexibility and appropriate incentives built into the current round of capital raising and the contract terms to carry the firm through its next stage of development.
GBUS8454 This course provides participants with experience in the analysis and resolution of financial issues in the context of the smaller enterprise that has no or, at best, limited access to the public capital markets. The course material seldom will deal with high-tech enterprises that are purchased with the intent of rapid resale. On the contrary, it deals with companies operating in the mundane, real world of the typical small-enterprise owner who needs sales to meet the payroll, wisely uses limited capital resources, carefully raises new funds, and must plan for the ultimate transfer of the business to new owners. The latter problem is unique to the small, privately held business. In addition to considering typical issues of asset management, including acquisitions and dispositions, the course will cover topics such as working-capital management, selecting funding sources and structuring loans, project finance, creating liquidity, and transferring the business to the next generation or selling it. The tools required for this course were introduced in First Year Financial Management and Policies; emphasis will be on applying those tools in the small-enterprise context.
GBUS8455 This course is designed to help students develop an understanding and competency set for optimizing organic revenue growth across the life cycle of an organization. It explores practical steps and actions for revenue expansion from internal sources.
GBUS8456 This course introduces intervention methods and skills to unleash the potential of whole organizational systems by transforming an organization's culture. An organization's potential is unleashed when its cultural assumptions organize its activities in ways that excite and empower its members and its constituents to create extraordinary and meaningful results.
GBUS8457 The purpose of this course is to ensure that students master the definition, construction, applications, and weaknesses of common marketing metrics.  The course aims to help students understand how metrics are used in assessing the long-term health of brands and customer relationships.
GBUS8458 This course covers the management processes by which general managers manage businesses, addressing both public and private businesses. The course begins by introducing the concept of management levels, corporate, business, functional and operating. It covers the roles and responsibilities of managers at each level, with emphasis on the general management responsibility to coordinate activities between organizational levels.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8459 The course examines how design thinking and innovation principles can be used to enhance the value and accelerate the development of business opportunities that deliver organic growth. Students will apply design methodologies and innovation tools in a live, corporate project, working closely with a client company with a real problem to solve.
GBUS8460 This course will provide students with a strong conceptual and applied understanding of the theory and practice of portfolio management. Students will first examine classical modern portfolio theory that will form the foundation for an exploration of the practice of portfolio management through case discussions and with guest lecturers. Topics will include modern portfolio theory, investment policy, portfolio strategy, asset allocation, market efficiency, and performance evaluation. Students will be challenged to evaluate the validity of theory and conventional practice as guidance for managing portfolios. The course will feature a combination of cases, guest lecturers from industry, and readings. Although most relevant to students planning careers in investment management and research, the course also should be valuable to students interested in managing their own investments. Valuation in Financial Markets is a prerequisite for this course.
GBUS8461 The Enterprise Perspective
GBUS8462 This course will expose students to the leading frameworks and best practices of professional selling, specifically addressing the complex purchasing processes and sophisticated buyers that define today's business-to-business relationships.

Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8463 This course is intended to provide students with a comprehensive conceptual and applied understanding of the sustainability challenges and opportunities facing corporations on a global scale with primary emphasis on environmental sustainability. Students will be exposed to a variety of pressing sustainability issues and to new techniques and approaches for successfully dealing with them.   Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8464 The course gives students the opportunity to hear marketing experts discuss the most current marketing issues facing companies today. Each class will feature a speaker who will either introduce a new issue to the class or bring a different perspective on an issue already introduced by a previous speaker. The content of the course will vary according to what topics are in the news as well as the availability of speakers.   Prerequisites: Restricted toDarden students.
GBUS8465 This course is intended to provide students with an understanding of the design and use of planning and control systems to facilitate the implementation of an organization's strategy. Many organizations have discovered that having a great strategy is not enough if the right structures and processes are not in place to implement that strategy.
GBUS8466 The course offers a means for students to gain direct exposure to the world of practical affairs by engaging Darden alumni with expertise in technology and operations management. It will expose students to a range of emerging issues and topics in technology management and operations management and will be organized around four topic areas to enable in-depth discussions over multiple class sessions.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8467 The Enterprise Perspective (EP) course is designed to build on the theme introduced in Leadership Residency 1 course, 'Leading with an Enterprise Perspective.' The EP course will consist of sessions during which students are encouraged to perceive situations and diagnose problems and then make essential tradeoffs or reconcile management decisions based on a multifunctional point of view.
GBUS8468 This course focuses on how operating managers identify growth opportunities, create focused growth strategies, and execute them successfully. Organic growth is primarily nonacquisitive growth resulting from geographic, product, service, concept, and customer expansion or from increased operating efficiencies and productivity. Growth will be studied from the strategic, process, and general management perspectives.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8469 This course focuses on the challenges entrepreneurs face in building ventures. Its purpose is to present students with a series of diverse management situations faced by entrepreneurs with companies at different stages of development. In each class, students will hear from and interact with experienced entrepreneurs and learn both from their successes and their failures.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8470 The course focuses on capital raising in the United States and international markets and has as its ultimate goal a greater understanding of the capital acquisition process while it emphasizes capital raising in public markets. The course covers the institutional process of security issuance, the formal rules and regulations as well as the informal norms and practices of the marketplace. Issuance in public security markets entails strict adherence to these rules and regulations that govern the marketplace. While these rules place more limitations on managers' actions than private placements, the United States and the developed world's capital markets offer firms the broadest array of possible funding sources at the lowest cost. Students will survey a number of commonly used financing arrangements, such as follow-on equity issues, initial public offerings, ADRs, and several forms of straight and convertible debt. The course targets students with professional interests in corporate finance, commercial and investment banking, financial services, and management consulting.
GBUS8472 In this course, students can master the process of adapting technology to the needs of the market and developing an actionable strategy. Students will learn the integrative skills necessary to do a startup even if they are not prepared to commit to the Incubator.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8473 Based on the premise that global leaders are made, not born, this course is designed to help students explore the battery of perspectives and skills on which great global leaders rely. The course provides an opportunity for students to begin the personal transition toward mastery of global leadership capabilities.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8474 This course explores the challenges of leading those with whom we do not have direct contact and is a companion course to GBUS 8703 Tactical Leadership.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.

GBUS8610 This course is designed primarily for students seeking a marketing career in organizations that market products and services to other organizations. While the course is aimed at those interested in business-to-business marketing, it is also appropriate for those seeking careers in consulting, manufacturing, and nonmarketing functional areas of business-to-business firms. The course emphasizes the tactical aspects of business marketing as well as conceptual and strategic elements of the marketing-planning process. The course begins by examining how to organize the marketing function and then moves to the topics of buyer-seller relationships, sales force management, complexities and problems inherent in forging longer term partnerships, and developing and managing complex distribution systems along with some exposure to product development and launch. Cases have been chosen from a variety of settings, ranging from high tech to 'metal bending' and from the emerging to the more mature businesses. As opportunities arise, the course will incorporate a 'live' case. Working with a company to address critical marketing problems, student teams will be assigned to work on these problems. These projects comprise the final project for the course and take the class work from the written-case analysis to the real-time case analysis. Topics for study are chosen based on the importance to the firm and on the relevance of the topic to the content of the course.
GBUS8611 The course is intended primarily for those who are considering careers with financial service organizations that serve as competitive financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks, investment banks, money managers, and insurance companies. The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum.
GBUS8612 This course will expose students to the challenges managing the product and service development process in a corporate environment. Specifically, students will address issues such as creativity and problem solving, technology evaluation and management, global R&D management, innovation portfolio management, stage-gate versus agile processes, modular design/product architecture, and crowd sourcing
GBUS8617 This course is intended for those desiring a deeper understanding of the problems of effecting turnarounds (restructurings) and workouts (resuscitations) than is available in other courses that briefly treat these matters. The course is structured to be relevant to those planning to work in marketing, operations, general management, smaller enterprises, and new ventures as well as those seeking a career as a workout specialist. It will not qualify participants as experts in legal and tax niceties and is not designed to help identify undervalued turnaround opportunities. It is not a course in vulture finance. The course focuses more on the causes and warning signs of trouble, on what can be done to protect and restore a company's health, and on dealing with the aggrieved financial sources that are inevitably but unwillingly involved. The complexity of major turnarounds and workouts requires that the course material deal primarily with smaller companies and exclusively with U.S. companies.
GBUS8618 This course deals with important aspects of starting, developing, and growing a technology enterprise. We start by defining and providing perspective on high technology entrepreneurship, emphasizing the creation of highly scalable ventures.

GBUS8622 New cases will provide opportunities to forecast quantities in a variety of domains from operations to marketing to finance. In this course, students will examine big data analytics and tools that have been written about in the public press (web scrapers, SQL, Tableau, R).
GBUS8623 This course examines the nature and influence of trading in financial markets. Trading is a repeated-play game that usually entails making numerous decisions under conditions of uncertainty. In the course, particular attention is directed to the role of noise in financial markets; cognitive illusions and pitfalls in decision making by market participants; the identification of potentially profitable trades; the development of sound money management skills, arbitrage and quasi-arbitrage transactions; positive feedback trading, back office processing of trades; the management of the trading function; and the development of various expert trading systems. Two mock pit-trading sessions will give students firsthand experience in simulated pit-trading environments and illustrate necessary trading skills. A simulated trading game runs for most of the course. Guest lectures in class from top traders as well as the interviews of top traders in the texts provide diverse perspectives on trading by successful traders.
GBUS8624 The strategic and tactical problems of managing the operations function in the service environment are examined in this course. Topics include capacity management, Lean thinking, the role of operations in defining and delivering a competitive advantage in services and service-design thinking.
GBUS8625 This course is designed to provide students with a practical understanding of the merger and acquisition marketplace, addressing such topics as why companies grow through acquisitions, how acquisition or merger candidates are analyzed strategically and valued financially, and ultimately, whether and how mergers and acquisitions create value for stakeholders. Takeovers and mergers are a daily fact of life, have evolved into a critical part of every CEO or manager's strategic toolbox, and will most likely affect every person who enters the corporate world at some point in their career. Whether a student chooses to be a senior corporate manager, an M&A practitioner, or merely an informed armchair observer, the course is intended to provide the analytical framework to evaluate an acquisition from a strategic, financial, structural, tactical, legal, and ethical perspective. Students will apply learned content to real business situations, including the opportunity to develop, create, and present an acquisition proposal to an actual corporate client during the class.
GBUS8626 Recent droughts and the soaring food prices they trigger underscore that freshwater scarcity will be a major challenge in the 21st century. In spite of reports about imminent water crises, the world is not running out of water. It is especially the very uneven distribution of water, across and within countries, that is a concern. There is a need for improved water management.
GBUS8627 This course is based on the assumption that nonprofit organizations benefit individuals and society in numerous ways. It is designed to introduce students to the scope and the diversity of nonprofit organizations, to the unique governance, communications, and financing structures inherent in them, and to the innovative and creative opportunities available in them for well-trained and flexible management professionals.
GBUS8630 This course is designed to expose students to advanced quantitative techniques in marketing research. The course deals with how marketers can extract useful information from marketing data for designing marketing strategies. The emphasis in the course is on advanced data analysis relevant for marketing decisions. Topics will include techniques relevant for new product pretests, product line pricing, demand forecasting, market and customer segmentation, allocating resources for advertising and promotion, customer valuation, and evaluating marketing campaign performance. Course content will feature a combination of cases, exercises, lectures, and a group project. The course will use a very hands-on approach and a majority of the topics covered in this course will have direct applicability to those students concentrating in marketing in their future jobs. Students are advised to take the Marketing Intelligence course prior to this course.
GBUS8631 Most of the quantitative models students have encountered thus far at Darden have been evaluative in nature, so their purpose has been to analyze or evaluate a particular alternative. The task of selecting the optimal alternative has been left for them to complete outside the model (i.e., the model helps us analyze and compare individual alternatives but does not actually identify the optimal solution for us).
GBUS8632 This course will provide foundational skills for managers involved in developing software applications. These skills would be relevant to the future entrepreneur as well as to the future manager within an established company. The applications might be finished products for the end user (e.g., an iPhone app) or they might be internal systems built on vendor platforms (e.g., Salesforce or Oracle deployment).
GBUS8633 For the Darden student who wants to increase their creative confidence on software related projects, Software Development is an experiential SY elective that delivers hands-on coding experience for the non-engineer.  Unlike online only options like codeacademy, SID offers a Darden compatible format with the hands-on assistance that students need to acquire the necessary skills in a single quarter.
GBUS8634 This course is an opportunity for students to learn effective interviewing, talent evaluation, verbal and written communication, marketing skills, and leadership skills. In addition, the course teaches students to interact with a diverse group of people and gain insights into their potential through active listening.

GBUS8645 The course will explore the issues facing leaders in the region through engagements in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Bahrain. These two countries have adopted different approaches to economic development and their vision for the future while considering their long tradition and history. We will explore the current and future plans for economic development, the role of business leaders in shaping these changes and their roles.
GBUS8690 This course examines the concepts involved in interactive marketing. Interactive marketing is characterized by activities that address customers directly (usually through some form of response advertising) for the purposes of initiating an exchange as well as developing, managing, and exploiting a customer relationship. Interactive marketing encompasses aspects of direct mail, customer relationship management, and Internet marketing. The ability to communicate with individual customers often allows the marketer to measure and manage each customer relationship separately. The results of response advertising campaigns are also measurable, testable, and data-base driven, thus converting the abstract aspect of marketing into the universal language of numbers. The course includes exercises in which students have the opportunity to apply and test the principles of interactive marketing in simulated business environments.
GBUS8699 This course is intended to provide students with an opportunity to work closely with a faculty adviser to produce a case study of a real business situation. Students may already have a case setting in mind or may call upon their faculty supervisor for an introduction to the setting for a case.
GBUS8700 This course is intended to provide students with an opportunity to work closely with a faculty adviser to produce a case study of a real business situation. Students may already have a case setting in mind or may call upon their faculty supervisor for an introduction to the setting for a case.
GBUS8701 This course focuses on the leadership qualities that are necessary to successfully design and implement strategic change and how being involved in the active leadership process requires individuals to be willing to define and declare themselves in strategic ways. The course is an elective and follows the format of the Leading Strategic Change course. It puts its emphasis on the need for students to think on personal, professional, and enterprise levels and to apply this thinking to the critical issues of leading and managing individual and organizational change. It is essential that students studying for an MBA develop a rich appreciation for the implications of personal and organizational change. Leadership is a personal declaration and as such is the essence of change. The principal modes of instruction are cases, lectures, and readings.
GBUS8703 Tactical Leadership (TL) focuses on interpersonal influence and persuasion (as opposed to self-leadership that focuses on self-management or strategic leadership that focuses on organizational decision making and non-face-to-face influence). Students will decide what buy-in means and what their best chances for generating it is when they have the chance to look someone in the eye.      Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8704 The premise of this course is that students can learn a great deal about leadership by studying the leadership of others. Values and ethics as essential elements of leadership are the central focus. The course will provide students with examples and models of ways in which leaders have incorporated ethics and values into many definitions of leadership. Students will have the opportunity to reflect on their own values and ethics as well as examine and build upon their own definition of leadership. Each session will be devoted to a different leader, focusing on their background, context, and type of leadership they displayed. Insights from these leaders and an array of readings on leadership will be used to foster reflection on what makes a great leader. The majority of leaders chosen for study, although familiar, are not business entrepreneurs or leaders of large corporations. The idea is to think more broadly about what makes great leadership by looking at a series of figures who offer a range of approaches to leadership and the value systems that can underlie it. Some leaders covered in past courses were Sir Ernest Shackleton, George Patton, Chairman Mao, Oscar Schindler, Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Martin Luther King, Jr., Mustafa Ataturk, Al Groh, Cynthia Cooper, Ann Fudge, and Muhammad Yunus. Our focus will be on these leaders, their stories, and how they connect values and leadership, but at the end of each study students will connect the discussions back to the present and their challenges as future leaders.
GBUS8705 This course integrates diversity and leadership themes while simultaneously broadening the literary exposure of students. While condensed readings from the classics of literature are used, the selection of excerpts has culturally diverse protagonists such as Mahatma Gandhi and Virginia Woolf, who confronted leadership challenges much like those encountered today. These writings continue to influence our thinking and assumptions about how to manage people. The readings are from the Hartwick Classic Leadership casebank and range from 14 to 40 pages in length.
GBUS8706 The course consists of a case and text-based learning experience that focuses on the leadership challenges involved in leveraging diversity. Students will learn how leaders must have the basic skills and the ability and willingness to recognize diversity and then leverage it through invitation, inclusion, and inspiration.
GBUS8707 Today's leaders not only experience change, but are called upon to change themselves and the organizations in which they work. Leading through individual and organizational change can be challenging, but leaders do not have to face these challenges alone. In this course, you are invited to engage with a leadership coach in a creative and thought-provoking process that inspires you to reach your full potential.
GBUS8708 This course will examine the business of medicine in the current health policy/health politics landscape, drawing on participant experiences and using a case method. Students will prepare presentations on current health business and health policy topics.
GBUS8730 This course is an opportunity for students to get real-time experience in a guided setting about the way they form work relationships, observe interactions, think through difficult situations, and learn from the choices made. In this full-semester course, students prepare for the challenges posed by the increased use of teams in the workplace while working directly with first-year learning teams as the teams evolve throughout the first semester. The relationship formed with a student's first-year team and documented through weekly required observations becomes a live and continuing case throughout the term. The first part of the course focuses on the learning team's evolution, supplemented by ongoing delivery of relevant group theory. The second part of the course broadens the focus to include the contemporary issues and challenges of workplace teams, such as leading your group at work, managing coordinating teams in strategic alliances, and teaching others to be better team members. The course is most successful when students commit the time and energy needed to maintain weekly contact with their team and remain open to learning about themselves and others in the process.
GBUS8750 This course will focus on the major psychological issues that underlie and contribute to the effective and, at times, ineffective performance of people in managerial roles. It begins with the development of a model of personality. The initial development model is necessary for setting the stage for the remaining sessions of the course that build on and add to this framework. During the course, topics such as gender, race, meanings, habits of excellence, relationships, creativity, and life-long growth will be examined. Students also will consider those issues that, although not visible at first glance, prove to be at the heart of why things are the way they are and not what they initially seem. Interactive conversations around reading materials provide much of the activity of this course.
GBUS8760 This course will increase students' awareness of the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and provide practical experiences that give them the opportunity to improve their interpersonal effectiveness. Students will learn that one of the most basic and profound contributions to managers' success is the ability to create high-quality relationships with colleagues and to link these relationships together to form a network that sustains its members and facilitates the organization's work. Because nearly every contribution made to an organization will be influenced by the quality of relationships sustained with others, effective leadership is, essentially, effective relationship management. Primary learning in the course comes from participation in face-to-face laboratory experiences while readings and cases serve as supplements. Topics include communication, feedback and performance appraisal, active listening, working with diversity, and confronting problems in working relationships. With emphasis on future management contexts, students will discover how others perceive them and what behaviors enhance or detract from their interpersonal effectiveness.
GBUS8800 This course explores the major issues and managerial concepts relating to strategic management of the operations function in today's global economy. The course targets prospective general managers. It is organized into three main topical groups, including an introduction to operations strategy concepts, an examination of operations strategy process tools, and the discussion of specific management decision areas within the operations strategy framework. Competitive cost analysis is emphasized and issues related to e-business operations strategy are included in the discussion of the topical issues. Business cases studied include a mix from both the manufacturing and service industries. Classes may feature visiting company executives, and there is a strong global emphasis throughout the course.
GBUS8830 The increasing globalization of business and heightened outsourcing in many industries has led to increased interest in supply chain management issues by the senior management of most companies. This course is designed to provide an understanding of the functional and strategic role of supply chains in both manufacturing and service industries, with emphasis on global supply chains originating or ending in North America. The course is oriented towards prospective general managers who desire to become more familiar with supply chain design and coordination as well as some of the major issues and managerial concepts relating to supply-chain management that are important sources of competitive advantage. The course is taught using textbook and article readings, cases, lectures, and guest speakers.
GBUS8840 Innovation plays an essential role in the development and achievement of long-term competitive advantage. This is a course in strategy and entrepreneurship with three main themes: Creating and Realizing Value, Prioritizing Opportunities, and Managing the Innovation Process. Within these themes, students will explore why innovation is invention that creates value and why some inventions do not create value; why projects involving the innovation process are notoriously difficult to value: how to set priorities when choosing among innovation opportunities; how to guide early stage research efforts toward potentially distant products; why managing the process requires thinking about the unfolding and often nonlinear stages; how multiple dimensions cumulate in success or failure; how to think about the many uncertainties and manage the risks such as running out of cash; how to deal with the changes of course, challenges of competition, setbacks, and forward leaps in managing big, long-term innovation efforts; and, most importantly, how the outcomes of this process depend on the people involved. This course deals with both small and large corporations and usually encompasses a range of technologies.
GBUS8850 The pace of Internet business evolution has proven to be as rapid during the extinction phase as it was in the evolutionary phase for new companies and their business models. The course will examine the business models and strategies of both pure-play survivors and established firms to understand the keys to successfully exploiting the Internet and related technologies.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.
GBUS8870 This course helps students become conversant with contemporary issues in the field of strategic management both in theory and practice. It covers selected strategy topics in depth that are chosen from three areas: First Year Strategy, current practice and issues, and current research in strategy and related fields of economics and organizational sociology. Four streams of literature will be discussed: organizational economics, resource-based/dynamic-capabilities view of the firm, business psychology, and business sociology. The course will allow students to become more conversant with relevant current issues in strategic thinking and the practice of strategy and to treat ideas in greater depth and rigor than possible in a traditional case course. Through this dialogue, students will sharpen their strategic thinking abilities and instincts. The course content will consist of a variety of readings from books, management and academic journals, and working papers. Class meets once a week, and the reading load is extensive. Grading will be based on class participation, weekly one-page papers, and a final essay.
GBUS8900 This course will be treated as a workshop in decision consulting and modeling. It will develop additional methodology and more advanced applications for students who were comfortable in First Year Decision Analysis and wish to pick up where that course left off without significant overlap. Applications receiving special attention in this course are financial modeling, such as the random walk, hedging, and modeling of real options; strategy analysis and modeling, including structuring models, hybrid strategies, and contingent strategy under uncertainty; and marketing models, such as brand-switching dynamics. One class day will be treated as a real-time modeling studio, where the class works together on a task provided in a one-page case at the beginning of class. New methodology will treat risk preference, risk management, correlated variables and scenarios, risk exposure, dynamic uncertainty models, Optquest for optimization within simulation models, and the decision quality process used in decision consulting. Students will use Excel and a number of add-in software products.
GBUS8910 This course will review, reinforce, and extend the basic concepts gained from the required Decision Analysis course, such as spreadsheet construction, simulation, regression, decision trees, and optimization. The two primary objectives of the course are to improve students' basic analytical skills and to strengthen their ability to integrate quantitative analysis into their general decision-making process. This course and Management Decision Models are intended for students interested in further core Decision Analysis instruction and is designed for those students who were comfortable with Decision Analysis and wish to pick up where it left off without significant overlap. Students who feel the need for significant review and reinforcement of the Decision Analysis content with modest extensions will benefit from this course. Thus, those students who made an A or B+ in Decision Analysis probably will find that this course does not meet your educational objectives and should consider a course that is more appropriate. Please contact the instructor if you have questions in this regard.
GBUS8930 This course focuses on two-party negotiations in a wide variety of settings ranging from simple buyer-seller bargains to complex, multi-issue strategic relationships. Most class sessions revolve around the results of negotiations between class members that are conducted prior to class, as preparation for the session. The results of these negotiations are displayed each day and provide an opportunity for explicit feedback on each student's negotiating performance. Class discussion reviews the wide variety of experiences in the specific negotiation and develops and tests hypotheses regarding effective behaviors, tactics, and strategies. The resulting ideas are reinforced and further developed through a series of weekly readings. Finally, the course offers several frameworks for codifying each student's negotiation toolkit and for describing each student's negotiation behavior.
